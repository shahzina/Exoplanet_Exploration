### Observations: 

The deep neural network performs better than SVM. The model gets better once it reaches close to a 100 epochs, on increasing the epochs from 100 to 150 the efficiency increased but on feeding test data to the model it can be seen that there was overfitting. 

SVMs maybe a good choice for smaller datasets, but we require deep neural nets larger ones in order to train properly.
